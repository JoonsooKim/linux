Subject: [PATCH v3] mm/compaction: redesign compaction: part1

Major changes from v2:
o Split patchset into two parts, one is for replacing compaction
deferring with compaction limit and the other is for changing
scanner activity
o Add some fixes and cleanup for current defer logic
o Fix opposite direction problem in "skip useless pfn when..." patch
o Reuse current defer logic for compaction limit
o Provide proper argument when calling __reset_isolation_suitable()
o Prevent async compaction while compaction limit is activated

Previous cover-letter isn't appropriate for this part1 patchset so
I just append link about it.

New description:
Compaction deferring effectively reduces compaction overhead if
compaction success isn't expected. But, it is implemented that
skipping a number of compaction requests until compaction is re-enabled.
Due to this implementation, unfortunate compaction requestor will get
whole compaction overhead unlike others have zero overhead. And, after
deferring start to work, even if compaction success possibility is
restored, we should skip to compaction in some number of times.

This patch try to solve above problem by using compaction limit.
Instead of imposing compaction overhead to one unfortunate requestor,
compaction limit distributes overhead to all compaction requestors.
All requestors have a chance to migrate some amount of pages and
after limit is exhausted compaction will be stopped. This will fairly
distributes overhead to all compaction requestors. And, because we don't
defer compaction request, someone will succeed to compact as soon as
possible if compaction success possiblility is restored.

I tested this patch on my compaction benchmark and found that high-order
allocation latency is evenly distributed and there is no latency spike
in the situation where compaction success isn't possible.

Following is the result of each high-order allocation latency (ns).

As you can see, Base has a latency spike periodically, but,
in Limit, latency is distributed evenly.

This patchset is based on linux-next-20151106 +
"restore COMPACT_CLUSTER_MAX to 32" + "__compact_pgdat() code cleanuup"
which are sent by me today.

Thanks.
